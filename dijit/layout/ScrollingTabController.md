## Summary

Set of tabs with left/right arrow keys and a menu to switch between tabs not
all fitting on a single row.
Works only for horizontal tabs (either above or below the content, not to the left
or right).
## Properties

### attachScope
Object to which attach points and events will be scoped.  Defaults
to 'this'.

### attributeMap
Deprecated.  Instead of attributeMap, widget should have a _setXXXAttr attribute
for each XXX attribute to be mapped to the DOM.

attributeMap sets up a "binding" between attributes (aka properties)
of the widget and the widget's DOM.
Changes to widget attributes listed in attributeMap will be
reflected into the DOM.

For example, calling set('title', 'hello')
on a TitlePane will automatically cause the TitlePane's DOM to update
with the new title.

attributeMap is a hash where the key is an attribute of the widget,
and the value reflects a binding to a:

- DOM node attribute

        focus: {node: "focusNode", type: "attribute"}

Maps this.focus to this.focusNode.focus

- DOM node innerHTML

        title: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerHTML" }

Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerHTML

- DOM node innerText

        title: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerText" }

Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerText

- DOM node CSS class

        myClass: { node: "domNode", type: "class" }

Maps this.myClass to this.domNode.className

If the value is an array, then each element in the array matches one of the
formats of the above list.

There are also some shorthands for backwards compatibility:

- string --> { node: string, type: "attribute" }, for example:


      "focusNode" ---> { node: "focusNode", type: "attribute" }


- "" --> { node: "domNode", type: "attribute" }

### baseClass


### buttonWidget
The tab widget to create to correspond to each page

### buttonWidgetCloseClass
Class of [x] close icon, used by event delegation code to tell when close button was clicked

### class


### containerId
The id of the page container that I point to

### containerNode
Designates where children of the source DOM node will be placed.
"Children" in this case refers to both DOM nodes and widgets.
For example, for myWidget:


      <div data-dojo-type=myWidget>
        <b> here's a plain DOM node
        <span data-dojo-type=subWidget>and a widget</span>
        <i> and another plain DOM node </i>
      </div>


containerNode would point to:


        <b> here's a plain DOM node
        <span data-dojo-type=subWidget>and a widget</span>
        <i> and another plain DOM node </i>


In templated widgets, "containerNode" is set via a
data-dojo-attach-point assignment.

containerNode must be defined for any widget that accepts innerHTML
(like ContentPane or BorderContainer or even Button), and conversely
is null for widgets that don't, like TextBox.

### contextRequire
Used to provide a context require to the dojo/parser in order to be
able to use relative MIDs (e.g. `./Widget`) in the widget's template.

### declaredClass


### dir
Bi-directional support, as defined by the [HTML DIR](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#adef-dir)
attribute. Either left-to-right "ltr" or right-to-left "rtl".  If undefined, widgets renders in page's
default direction.

### domNode
This is our visible representation of the widget! Other DOM
Nodes may by assigned to other properties, usually through the
template system's data-dojo-attach-point syntax, but the domNode
property is the canonical "top level" node in widget UI.

### focused
This widget or a widget it contains has focus, or is "active" because
it was recently clicked.

### id
A unique, opaque ID string that can be assigned by users or by the
system. If the developer passes an ID which is known not to be
unique, the specified ID is ignored and the system-generated ID is
used instead.

### lang
Rarely used.  Overrides the default Dojo locale used to render this widget,
as defined by the [HTML LANG](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#adef-lang) attribute.
Value must be among the list of locales specified during by the Dojo bootstrap,
formatted according to [RFC 3066](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt) (like en-us).

### ownerDocument
The document this widget belongs to.  If not specified to constructor, will default to
srcNodeRef.ownerDocument, or if no sourceRef specified, then to the document global

### searchContainerNode


### srcNodeRef
pointer to original DOM node

### style
HTML style attributes as cssText string or name/value hash

### tabPosition
Defines where tabs go relative to the content.
"top", "bottom", "left-h", "right-h"

### tabStripClass
The css class to apply to the tab strip, if it is visible.

### templatePath
Path to template (HTML file) for this widget relative to dojo.baseUrl.
Deprecated: use templateString with require([... "dojo/text!..."], ...) instead

### templateString


### title
HTML title attribute.

For form widgets this specifies a tooltip to display when hovering over
the widget (just like the native HTML title attribute).

For TitlePane or for when this widget is a child of a TabContainer, AccordionContainer,
etc., it's used to specify the tab label, accordion pane title, etc.

### tooltip
When this widget's title attribute is used to for a tab label, accordion pane title, etc.,
this specifies the tooltip to appear when the mouse is hovered over that text.

### useMenu
True if a menu should be used to select tabs when they are too
wide to fit the TabContainer, false otherwise.

### useSlider
True if a slider should be used to select tabs when they are too
wide to fit the TabContainer, false otherwise.

### widgetsInTemplate
Should we parse the template to find widgets that might be
declared in markup inside it?  (Remove for 2.0 and assume true)

## Methods

### addChild
Makes the given widget a child of this widget.

### adjacent
Helper for onkeydown to find next/previous button

### attr
Set or get properties on a widget instance.

### buildRendering


### connect
Deprecated, will be removed in 2.0, use this.own(on(...)) or this.own(aspect.after(...)) instead.

Connects specified obj/event to specified method of this object
and registers for disconnect() on widget destroy.

Provide widget-specific analog to dojo.connect, except with the
implicit use of this widget as the target object.
Events connected with `this.connect` are disconnected upon
destruction.

### create
Kick off the life-cycle of a widget

### createSmoothScroll
Creates a dojo._Animation object that smoothly scrolls the tab list
either to a fixed horizontal pixel value, or to the selected tab.

### defer
Wrapper to setTimeout to avoid deferred functions executing
after the originating widget has been destroyed.
Returns an object handle with a remove method (that returns null) (replaces clearTimeout).

### destroy


### destroyDescendants
Recursively destroy the children of this widget and their
descendants.

### destroyRecursive
Destroy this widget and its descendants

### destroyRendering
Destroys the DOM nodes associated with this widget.

### disconnect
Deprecated, will be removed in 2.0, use handle.remove() instead.

Disconnects handle created by `connect`.

### doSlide
Scrolls the tab list to the left or right by 75% of the widget width.

### doSlideLeft
Scrolls the menu to the left.

### doSlideRight
Scrolls the menu to the right.

### emit
Used by widgets to signal that a synthetic event occurred, ex:

      myWidget.emit("attrmodified-selectedChildWidget", {}).


Emits an event on this.domNode named type.toLowerCase(), based on eventObj.
Also calls onType() method, if present, and returns value from that method.
By default passes eventObj to callback, but will pass callbackArgs instead, if specified.
Modifies eventObj by adding missing parameters (bubbles, cancelable, widget).

### get
Get a property from a widget.

### getChildren
Returns all direct children of this widget, i.e. all widgets underneath this.containerNode whose parent
is this widget.   Note that it does not return all descendants, but rather just direct children.
Analogous to [Node.childNodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Node.childNodes),
except containing widgets rather than DOMNodes.

The result intentionally excludes internally created widgets (a.k.a. supporting widgets)
outside of this.containerNode.

Note that the array returned is a simple array.  Application code should not assume
existence of methods like forEach().

### getDescendants
Returns all the widgets contained by this, i.e., all widgets underneath this.containerNode.
This method should generally be avoided as it returns widgets declared in templates, which are
supposed to be internal/hidden, but it's left here for back-compat reasons.

### getIndexOfChild
Gets the index of the child in this container or -1 if not found

### getParent
Returns the parent widget of this widget.

### hasChildren
Returns true if widget has child widgets, i.e. if this.containerNode contains widgets.

### isFocusable
Return true if this widget can currently be focused
and false if not

### isLeftToRight
Return this widget's explicit or implicit orientation (true for LTR, false for RTL)

### on

### onClick
Connect to this function to receive notifications of mouse click events.

### onClose
Called when this widget is being displayed as a popup (ex: a Calendar popped
up from a DateTextBox), and it is hidden.
This is called from the dijit.popup code, and should not be called directly.

Also used as a parameter for children of `dijit/layout/StackContainer` or subclasses.
Callback if a user tries to close the child.   Child will be closed if this function returns true.

### onCloseButtonClick
Called whenever one of my child buttons [X] is pressed in an attempt to close a page

### onContainerKeyDown
Called when there was a keydown on the container

### onDblClick

`dijit/layout/TabContainer`, `dijit/layout/StackContainer`,
`dijit/layout/AccordionContainer`, etc.

Also called to indicate hide of a `dijit.Dialog`, `dijit.TooltipDialog`, or `dijit.TitlePane`.

### onKeyDown

### onShow
Called when this widget becomes the selected pane in a
`dijit/layout/TabContainer`, `dijit/layout/StackContainer`,
`dijit/layout/AccordionContainer`, etc.

Also called to indicate display of a `dijit.Dialog`, `dijit.TooltipDialog`, or `dijit.TitlePane`.

### onStartup


### onkeydown
Handle keystrokes on the page list, for advancing to next/previous button
and closing the current page if the page is closable.

### own

useful to set properties that are referenced in the widget
template.

### postscript

### subscribe
Deprecated, will be removed in 2.0, use this.own(topic.subscribe()) instead.

Subscribes to the specified topic and calls the specified method
of this object and registers for unsubscribe() on widget destroy.

Provide widget-specific analog to dojo.subscribe, except with the
implicit use of this widget as the target object.

### uninitialize
Deprecated. Override destroy() instead to implement custom widget tear-down
behavior.

### unsubscribe
Deprecated, will be removed in 2.0, use handle.remove() instead.

Unsubscribes handle created by this.subscribe.
Also removes handle from this widget's list of subscriptions

### watch
Watches a property for changes
