## Summary

Future base class for all Dijit widgets.
## Description

Future base class for all Dijit widgets.
_Widget extends this class adding support for various features needed by desktop.

Provides stubs for widget lifecycle methods for subclasses to extend, like postMixInProperties(), buildRendering(),
postCreate(), startup(), and destroy(), and also public API methods like set(), get(), and watch().

Widgets can provide custom setters/getters for widget attributes, which are called automatically by set(name, value).
For an attribute XXX, define methods _setXXXAttr() and/or _getXXXAttr().

_setXXXAttr can also be a string/hash/array mapping from a widget attribute XXX to the widget's DOMNodes:

- DOM node attribute

    _setFocusAttr: {node: "focusNode", type: "attribute"}
    _setFocusAttr: "focusNode"  (shorthand)
    _setFocusAttr: ""    (shorthand, maps to this.domNode)

Maps this.focus to this.focusNode.focus, or (last example) this.domNode.focus

- DOM node innerHTML

    _setTitleAttr: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerHTML" }

Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerHTML

- DOM node innerText

    _setTitleAttr: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerText" }

Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerText

- DOM node CSS class

    _setMyClassAttr: { node: "domNode", type: "class" }

Maps this.myClass to this.domNode.className

If the value of _setXXXAttr is an array, then each element in the array matches one of the
formats of the above list.

If the custom setter is null, no action is performed other than saving the new value
in the widget (in this).

If no custom setter is defined for an attribute, then it will be copied
to this.focusNode (if the widget defines a focusNode), or this.domNode otherwise.
That's only done though for attributes that match DOMNode attributes (title,
alt, aria-labelledby, etc.)
## Properties

### attributeMap
Deprecated.  Instead of attributeMap, widget should have a _setXXXAttr attribute
for each XXX attribute to be mapped to the DOM.

attributeMap sets up a "binding" between attributes (aka properties)
of the widget and the widget's DOM.
Changes to widget attributes listed in attributeMap will be
reflected into the DOM.

For example, calling set('title', 'hello')
on a TitlePane will automatically cause the TitlePane's DOM to update
with the new title.

attributeMap is a hash where the key is an attribute of the widget,
and the value reflects a binding to a:

- DOM node attribute

    focus: {node: "focusNode", type: "attribute"}

Maps this.focus to this.focusNode.focus

- DOM node innerHTML

    title: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerHTML" }

Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerHTML

- DOM node innerText

    title: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerText" }

Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerText

- DOM node CSS class

    myClass: { node: "domNode", type: "class" }

Maps this.myClass to this.domNode.className

If the value is an array, then each element in the array matches one of the
formats of the above list.

There are also some shorthands for backwards compatibility:

- string --> { node: string, type: "attribute" }, for example:


    "focusNode" ---> { node: "focusNode", type: "attribute" }


- "" --> { node: "domNode", type: "attribute" }

### baseClass
Root CSS class of the widget (ex: dijitTextBox), used to construct CSS classes to indicate
widget state.

### class


### containerNode
Designates where children of the source DOM node will be placed.
"Children" in this case refers to both DOM nodes and widgets.
For example, for myWidget:


    <div data-dojo-type=myWidget>
    <b> here's a plain DOM node
    <span data-dojo-type=subWidget>and a widget</span>
    <i> and another plain DOM node </i>
    </div>


containerNode would point to:


    <b> here's a plain DOM node
    <span data-dojo-type=subWidget>and a widget</span>
    <i> and another plain DOM node </i>


In templated widgets, "containerNode" is set via a
data-dojo-attach-point assignment.

containerNode must be defined for any widget that accepts innerHTML
(like ContentPane or BorderContainer or even Button), and conversely
is null for widgets that don't, like TextBox.

### declaredClass


### dir
Bi-directional support, as defined by the [HTML DIR](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#adef-dir)
attribute. Either left-to-right "ltr" or right-to-left "rtl".  If undefined, widgets renders in page's
default direction.

### domNode
This is our visible representation of the widget! Other DOM
Nodes may by assigned to other properties, usually through the
template system's data-dojo-attach-point syntax, but the domNode
property is the canonical "top level" node in widget UI.

### focused
This widget or a widget it contains has focus, or is "active" because
it was recently clicked.

### id
A unique, opaque ID string that can be assigned by users or by the
system. If the developer passes an ID which is known not to be
unique, the specified ID is ignored and the system-generated ID is
used instead.

### lang
Rarely used.  Overrides the default Dojo locale used to render this widget,
as defined by the [HTML LANG](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#adef-lang) attribute.
Value must be among the list of locales specified during by the Dojo bootstrap,
formatted according to [RFC 3066](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt) (like en-us).

### ownerDocument
The document this widget belongs to.  If not specified to constructor, will default to
srcNodeRef.ownerDocument, or if no sourceRef specified, then to the document global

### srcNodeRef
pointer to original DOM node

### style
HTML style attributes as cssText string or name/value hash

### title
HTML title attribute.

For form widgets this specifies a tooltip to display when hovering over
the widget (just like the native HTML title attribute).

For TitlePane or for when this widget is a child of a TabContainer, AccordionContainer,
etc., it's used to specify the tab label, accordion pane title, etc.

### tooltip
When this widget's title attribute is used to for a tab label, accordion pane title, etc.,
this specifies the tooltip to appear when the mouse is hovered over that text.

## Methods

### buildRendering
Construct the UI for this widget, setting this.domNode.
Most widgets will mixin `dijit._TemplatedMixin`, which implements this method.

### connect
Deprecated, will be removed in 2.0, use this.own(on(...)) or this.own(aspect.after(...)) instead.

Connects specified obj/event to specified method of this object
and registers for disconnect() on widget destroy.

Provide widget-specific analog to dojo.connect, except with the
implicit use of this widget as the target object.
Events connected with `this.connect` are disconnected upon
destruction.

### create
Kick off the life-cycle of a widget

### defer
Wrapper to setTimeout to avoid deferred functions executing
after the originating widget has been destroyed.
Returns an object handle with a remove method (that returns null) (replaces clearTimeout).

### destroy
Destroy this widget, but not its descendants.  Descendants means widgets inside of
this.containerNode.   Will also destroy any resources (including widgets) registered via this.own().

This method will also destroy internal widgets such as those created from a template,
assuming those widgets exist inside of this.domNode but outside of this.containerNode.

For 2.0 it's planned that this method will also destroy descendant widgets, so apps should not
depend on the current ability to destroy a widget without destroying its descendants.   Generally
they should use destroyRecursive() for widgets with children.

### destroyDescendants
Recursively destroy the children of this widget and their
descendants.

### destroyRecursive
Destroy this widget and its descendants

### destroyRendering
Destroys the DOM nodes associated with this widget.

### disconnect
Deprecated, will be removed in 2.0, use handle.remove() instead.

Disconnects handle created by `connect`.

### emit
Used by widgets to signal that a synthetic event occurred, ex:

    myWidget.emit("attrmodified-selectedChildWidget", {}).


Emits an event on this.domNode named type.toLowerCase(), based on eventObj.
Also calls onType() method, if present, and returns value from that method.
By default passes eventObj to callback, but will pass callbackArgs instead, if specified.
Modifies eventObj by adding missing parameters (bubbles, cancelable, widget).

### get
Get a property from a widget.

### getChildren
Returns all direct children of this widget, i.e. all widgets underneath this.containerNode whose parent
is this widget.   Note that it does not return all descendants, but rather just direct children.
Analogous to [Node.childNodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Node.childNodes),
except containing widgets rather than DOMNodes.

The result intentionally excludes internally created widgets (a.k.a. supporting widgets)
outside of this.containerNode.

Note that the array returned is a simple array.  Application code should not assume
existence of methods like forEach().

### getParent
Returns the parent widget of this widget.

### isFocusable
Return true if this widget can currently be focused
and false if not

### isLeftToRight
Return this widget's explicit or implicit orientation (true for LTR, false for RTL)

### on
Call specified function when event occurs, ex: myWidget.on("click", function(){ ... }).

### onBlur
Called when the widget stops being "active" because
focus moved to something outside of it, or the user
clicked somewhere outside of it, or the widget was
hidden.

### onFocus
Called when the widget becomes "active" because
it or a widget inside of it either has focus, or has recently
been clicked.

### own
Track specified handles and remove/destroy them when this instance is destroyed, unless they were
already removed/destroyed manually.

### placeAt
Place this widget somewhere in the DOM based
on standard domConstruct.place() conventions.

### postCreate
Processing after the DOM fragment is created

### postMixInProperties
Called after the parameters to the widget have been read-in,
but before the widget template is instantiated. Especially
useful to set properties that are referenced in the widget
template.

### postscript
Kicks off widget instantiation.  See create() for details.

### set
Set a property on a widget

### startup
Processing after the DOM fragment is added to the document

### subscribe
Deprecated, will be removed in 2.0, use this.own(topic.subscribe()) instead.

Subscribes to the specified topic and calls the specified method
of this object and registers for unsubscribe() on widget destroy.

Provide widget-specific analog to dojo.subscribe, except with the
implicit use of this widget as the target object.

### uninitialize
Deprecated. Override destroy() instead to implement custom widget tear-down
behavior.

### unsubscribe
Deprecated, will be removed in 2.0, use handle.remove() instead.

Unsubscribes handle created by this.subscribe.
Also removes handle from this widget's list of subscriptions

### watch
Watches a property for changes
