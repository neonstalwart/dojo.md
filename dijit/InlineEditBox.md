## Properties

### attributeMap
Deprecated.  Instead of attributeMap, widget should have a _setXXXAttr attribute
for each XXX attribute to be mapped to the DOM.

attributeMap sets up a "binding" between attributes (aka properties)
of the widget and the widget's DOM.
Changes to widget attributes listed in attributeMap will be
reflected into the DOM.

For example, calling set('title', 'hello')
on a TitlePane will automatically cause the TitlePane's DOM to update
with the new title.

attributeMap is a hash where the key is an attribute of the widget,
and the value reflects a binding to a:

- DOM node attribute

        focus: {node: "focusNode", type: "attribute"}

Maps this.focus to this.focusNode.focus

- DOM node innerHTML

        title: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerHTML" }

Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerHTML

- DOM node innerText

        title: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerText" }

Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerText

- DOM node CSS class

        myClass: { node: "domNode", type: "class" }

Maps this.myClass to this.domNode.className

If the value is an array, then each element in the array matches one of the
formats of the above list.

There are also some shorthands for backwards compatibility:

- string --> { node: string, type: "attribute" }, for example:


      "focusNode" ---> { node: "focusNode", type: "attribute" }


- "" --> { node: "domNode", type: "attribute" }

### autoSave
Changing the value automatically saves it; don't have to push save button
(and save button isn't even displayed)

### baseClass
Root CSS class of the widget (ex: dijitTextBox), used to construct CSS classes to indicate
widget state.

### buttonCancel
Cancel button label

### buttonSave
Save button label

### class


### containerNode
Designates where children of the source DOM node will be placed.
"Children" in this case refers to both DOM nodes and widgets.
For example, for myWidget:


      <div data-dojo-type=myWidget>
        <b> here's a plain DOM node
        <span data-dojo-type=subWidget>and a widget</span>
        <i> and another plain DOM node </i>
      </div>


containerNode would point to:


        <b> here's a plain DOM node
        <span data-dojo-type=subWidget>and a widget</span>
        <i> and another plain DOM node </i>


In templated widgets, "containerNode" is set via a
data-dojo-attach-point assignment.

containerNode must be defined for any widget that accepts innerHTML
(like ContentPane or BorderContainer or even Button), and conversely
is null for widgets that don't, like TextBox.

### declaredClass


### dir
Bi-directional support, as defined by the [HTML DIR](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#adef-dir)
attribute. Either left-to-right "ltr" or right-to-left "rtl".  If undefined, widgets renders in page's
default direction.

### disabled
If true, clicking the InlineEditBox to edit it will have no effect.

### domNode
This is our visible representation of the widget! Other DOM
Nodes may by assigned to other properties, usually through the
template system's data-dojo-attach-point syntax, but the domNode
property is the canonical "top level" node in widget UI.

### editing
Is the node currently in edit mode?

### editor
MID (ex: "dijit/form/TextBox") or constructor for editor widget

### editorParams
Set of parameters for editor, like {required: true}

### editorWrapper
Class name (or reference to the Class) for widget that wraps the editor widget, displaying save/cancel
buttons.

### focused
This widget or a widget it contains has focus, or is "active" because
it was recently clicked.

### id
A unique, opaque ID string that can be assigned by users or by the
system. If the developer passes an ID which is known not to be
unique, the specified ID is ignored and the system-generated ID is
used instead.

### lang
Rarely used.  Overrides the default Dojo locale used to render this widget,
as defined by the [HTML LANG](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#adef-lang) attribute.
Value must be among the list of locales specified during by the Dojo bootstrap,
formatted according to [RFC 3066](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt) (like en-us).

### noValueIndicator
The text that gets displayed when there is no value (so that the user has a place to click to edit)

### ownerDocument
The document this widget belongs to.  If not specified to constructor, will default to
srcNodeRef.ownerDocument, or if no sourceRef specified, then to the document global

### renderAsHtml
Set this to true if the specified Editor's value should be interpreted as HTML
rather than plain text (ex: `dijit.Editor`)

### srcNodeRef
pointer to original DOM node

### style
HTML style attributes as cssText string or name/value hash

### title
HTML title attribute.

For form widgets this specifies a tooltip to display when hovering over
the widget (just like the native HTML title attribute).

For TitlePane or for when this widget is a child of a TabContainer, AccordionContainer,
etc., it's used to specify the tab label, accordion pane title, etc.

### tooltip
When this widget's title attribute is used to for a tab label, accordion pane title, etc.,
this specifies the tooltip to appear when the mouse is hovered over that text.

### value
The display value of the widget in read-only mode

### width
Width of editor.  By default it's width=100% (ie, block mode).

## Methods

### attr
Set or get properties on a widget instance.

### buildRendering
Construct the UI for this widget, setting this.domNode.
Most widgets will mixin `dijit._TemplatedMixin`, which implements this method.

### cancel
Revert to display mode, discarding any changes made in the editor

### connect
Deprecated, will be removed in 2.0, use this.own(on(...)) or this.own(aspect.after(...)) instead.

Connects specified obj/event to specified method of this object
and registers for disconnect() on widget destroy.

Provide widget-specific analog to dojo.connect, except with the
implicit use of this widget as the target object.
Events connected with `this.connect` are disconnected upon
destruction.

### create
Kick off the life-cycle of a widget

### defer
Wrapper to setTimeout to avoid deferred functions executing
after the originating widget has been destroyed.
Returns an object handle with a remove method (that returns null) (replaces clearTimeout).

### destroy


### destroyDescendants
Recursively destroy the children of this widget and their
descendants.

### destroyRecursive
Destroy this widget and its descendants

### destroyRendering
Destroys the DOM nodes associated with this widget.

### disconnect
Deprecated, will be removed in 2.0, use handle.remove() instead.

Disconnects handle created by `connect`.

### edit
Display the editor widget in place of the original (read only) markup.

### emit
Used by widgets to signal that a synthetic event occurred, ex:

      myWidget.emit("attrmodified-selectedChildWidget", {}).


Emits an event on this.domNode named type.toLowerCase(), based on eventObj.
Also calls onType() method, if present, and returns value from that method.
By default passes eventObj to callback, but will pass callbackArgs instead, if specified.
Modifies eventObj by adding missing parameters (bubbles, cancelable, widget).

### get
Get a property from a widget.

### getChildren
Returns all direct children of this widget, i.e. all widgets underneath this.containerNode whose parent
is this widget.   Note that it does not return all descendants, but rather just direct children.
Analogous to [Node.childNodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Node.childNodes),
except containing widgets rather than DOMNodes.

The result intentionally excludes internally created widgets (a.k.a. supporting widgets)
outside of this.containerNode.

Note that the array returned is a simple array.  Application code should not assume
existence of methods like forEach().

### getDescendants
Returns all the widgets contained by this, i.e., all widgets underneath this.containerNode.
This method should generally be avoided as it returns widgets declared in templates, which are
supposed to be internal/hidden, but it's left here for back-compat reasons.

### getParent
Returns the parent widget of this widget.

### getValue
Deprecated.   Use get('value') instead.

### isFocusable
Return true if this widget can currently be focused
and false if not

### isLeftToRight
Return this widget's explicit or implicit orientation (true for LTR, false for RTL)

### on


### onBlur
Called when the widget stops being "active" because
focus moved to something outside of it, or the user
clicked somewhere outside of it, or the widget was
hidden.

### onCancel
Set this handler to be notified when editing is cancelled.

### onChange
Set this handler to be notified of changes to value.

### onClick
Connect to this function to receive notifications of mouse click events.

### onClose
Called when this widget is being displayed as a popup (ex: a Calendar popped
up from a DateTextBox), and it is hidden.
This is called from the dijit.popup code, and should not be called directly.

Also used as a parameter for children of `dijit/layout/StackContainer` or subclasses.
Callback if a user tries to close the child.   Child will be closed if this function returns true.

### onDblClick
Connect to this function to receive notifications of mouse double click events.

### onFocus
Called when the widget becomes "active" because
it or a widget inside of it either has focus, or has recently
been clicked.

### onHide
Called when another widget becomes the selected pane in a
`dijit/layout/TabContainer`, `dijit/layout/StackContainer`,
`dijit/layout/AccordionContainer`, etc.

Also called to indicate hide of a `dijit.Dialog`, `dijit.TooltipDialog`, or `dijit.TitlePane`.

### onKeyDown
Connect to this function to receive notifications of keys being pressed down.

### onKeyPress
Connect to this function to receive notifications of printable keys being typed.

### onKeyUp
Connect to this function to receive notifications of keys being released.

### onMouseDown
Connect to this function to receive notifications of when the mouse button is pressed down.

### onMouseEnter

`dijit/layout/TabContainer`, `dijit/layout/StackContainer`,
`dijit/layout/AccordionContainer`, etc.

Also called to indicate display of a `dijit.Dialog`, `dijit.TooltipDialog`, or `dijit.TitlePane`.

### own
Track specified handles and remove/destroy them when this instance is destroyed, unless they were
already removed/destroyed manually.

### placeAt
Place this widget somewhere in the DOM based
on standard domConstruct.place() conventions.

### setAttribute
Deprecated.  Use set() instead.

### setDisabled
Deprecated.   Use set('disabled', ...) instead.

### setValue
Deprecated.   Use set('value', ...) instead.

### startup
Processing after the DOM fragment is added to the document

### subscribe
Deprecated, will be removed in 2.0, use this.own(topic.subscribe()) instead.
