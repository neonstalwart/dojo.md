# Module: dojo/ready

## Summary

Add a function to execute on DOM content loaded and all requested modules have arrived and been evaluated.
In most cases, the `domReady` plug-in should suffice and this method should not be needed.

When called in a non-browser environment, just checks that all requested modules have arrived and been
evaluated.
