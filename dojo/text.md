# Module: dojo/text

## Summary

This module implements the dojo/text! plugin and the dojo.cache API.
## Description

We choose to include our own plugin to leverage functionality already contained in dojo
and thereby reduce the size of the plugin compared to various foreign loader implementations.
Also, this allows foreign AMD loaders to be used without their plugins.

CAUTION: this module is designed to optionally function synchronously to support the dojo v1.x synchronous
loader. This feature is outside the scope of the CommonJS plugins specification.
